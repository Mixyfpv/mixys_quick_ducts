# Mixy's Quick Ducts
## What this is
Mixy's Quick Ducts are 5 inches ducts designed to fit most - if not all - 5 inch FPV drones in production today.

These ducts were designed with one goal in mind, to be easy to use, and to be faster to put on and off your drone than currently available commercial solutions, as well as providing protection for bystanders when flying.

The ducts sit around the propeller disc. Their inside diameter is 5 inches.

It is expected that the duct will grind a bit of the props and its inside once you started the motors for the simple reason that the prop manufacturers tolerance to prop diameter varies. A lot. Around +- 1 mm. That is why you should not expect the prop to be perfectly flush against the inside of the duct.
3D printing imperfectiosn might also impact this.

The curve of the duct wall is an Epler 423 foil which appear to be very suited for this use.

## How it works

The best way to fix something like these ducts to your standard frame was to use the same nut and bolt size (M5) as 5 inches props we are used to.
Everyone is sure to have on hand the prop tool anywhere they fly, so this design fixation is centered aroud this idea.

Since the duct itself is frame agnostic, this means the duct holder (which is a dedicated arm pad) is the only dedicated part.
As you can see in the "arm_mount" directory, a few mounts are available.

All you need is an arm mount that will keep the nut centered on the prop axis and against the carbone frame.

The M5 bolt length should be around 15mm. Too long and it will push agaisnt the carbone frame and won't properly secure the flat area of the duct. Too short and it won't catch in the nut and won't secure the duct to the frame.

Lastly, for ease of use you can print a bolt holder (see "accessories") that will sit between the flat part of the duct and the underside of the arm mount. By driving the M5 bolt though this while it is in its definitive position, the bolt threads will catch and make the bolt secure to the duct, all the while it will be able to be released easily from the arm mount nut.
