# Mixy's Quick Ducts
## What this is
Mixy's Quick Ducts are 5 inches ducts designed to fit most - if not all - 5 inch FPV drones in production today.
![Alt text](pics_and_renders/duct5in_1.JPG?raw=true "Title")

These ducts were designed with one goal in mind, to be easy to use, and to be faster to put on and off your drone than currently available commercial solutions, as well as providing protection for bystanders when flying.

The ducts sit around the propeller disc. Their inside diameter is 5 inches.

It is expected that the duct will grind a bit of the props and its inside once you started the motors for the simple reason that the prop manufacturers tolerance to prop diameter varies. A lot. Around +- 1 mm. That is why you should not expect the prop to be perfectly flush against the inside of the duct.
3D printing imperfectiosn might also impact this.

The curve of the duct wall is an Eppler 423 airfoil which appear to be very suited for this use :

This ducts can be 3D printed. It has been tested with PLA+, regular PLA and PETG.
The arm mounts must be printed out of TPU.

## How to install
[Installation video]

- Fix arm mounts on your frame of choice. Like any arm mounts use your M3 screws to go thought the TPU mount and secure it flush to the arm underneath the motor. REMEMBER TO PUT THE M5 NUT in its location before securing the arm mount or you will have to do it all over again. (See "How it works" section).
- Push the duct around the prop through the gap between the duct arms and let one of the prop blades rest in the two "teeth". Make sure to angle these "teeth" toward the inde of the arm a it is where the arm will rest once fixed.

- Make sure the arms of the duct go around the front of the arm mount and the center top of the duct mount rest against the bottom of your arm mount.
- Center the M5 bolt to the center hole of the arm mount.
- Once the M5 bolt catches in the nut, make sure again that the teeth on the bottom side of the duct are going around the arm of the drone.
- Secure to your heart content. If properly secured you should be able to lift your drone by the duct with minimal vibrations.

## How it works
[Exploded view with TBS Source One v4]

The best way to fix something like these ducts to your standard frame was to use the same nut and bolt size (M5) as 5 inches props we are used to.
Everyone is sure to have on hand the prop tool anywhere they fly, so this design fixation is centered aroud this idea.

Since the duct itself is frame agnostic, this means the duct holder (which is a dedicated arm pad) is the only dedicated part.
As you can see in the "arm_mount" directory, a few mounts are available.

All you need is an arm mount that will keep the nut centered on the prop axis and against the carbone frame.

The M5 bolt length should be around 15mm. Too long and it will push agaisnt the carbone frame and won't properly secure the flat area of the duct. Too short and it won't catch in the nut and won't secure the duct to the frame.

Two "teeth" are used on side of the duct to make sure the duct does not rotate around the bolt by being installed around the arm of the drone.

On this same side, a divot as been made to the exterior of the duct to make it possible to rest agasint various frame top plates. For example, whilst the TBS Source One v4 provides enough space for it not to be needed, the Nazgul5 XL4 frame will need this space.

Lastly, for ease of use you can print a bolt holder (see "accessories") that will sit between the flat part of the duct and the underside of the arm mount. By driving the M5 bolt though this while it is in its definitive position, the bolt threads will catch and make the bolt secure to the duct, all the while it will be able to be released easily from the arm mount nut.

## What you need to use
- **1XM5 nut**

- **1XM5 bolt ~15mm**

And that's it.

## What it works with
Tested with these frames :
- Iflight Nazgul5 XL4
- Team Mistral AK47
- Team Mistral Dragunov
- TBS SOurce One V4/HD

## What this can become
This could become a great way for people that don't have the available resources to buy mutliple drones (like a dedicated cinewhoop) to be able to use their own drone and these 3D printable parts to fly around fragile things.

If you can't afford 350 bucks worth of drone to fly around people, use this and you'll be able to do it with whatever drone your currently flying.

Other dimensions will be added in the near future. And modify it however you want ! We want to see it grow.

Plus we should be able to add and swap parts on a drone in seconds instead of minutes. That is the final goal we want for this community.... The current record of putting the ducts on a drone is around 10 seconds per prop. Let's be even faster.
